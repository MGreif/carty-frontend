          Using PartyCarty, you can create a shopping list which can be shared

        <p>
          Everyone knows how stressful and confusing party-shopping (or shopping
          in general) could be. To evade this issue, you can create a PartyCarty
          in advance so all guests can add what they want and see what someone
          else is already buying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guests can vote for items so the person, thats buying the item can buy
          multiple pieces so other guests wont steal your golden piece!
